# base-opengl

A basic game framework using OpenGL, GLEW, GLFW, GLM, and [tinyobj loader](https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader). It is a starting point for any future projects that involve relatively simple but expensive graphics, such as [mandelbrot-gl](https://github.com/fingoldin/mandelbrot-gl).
